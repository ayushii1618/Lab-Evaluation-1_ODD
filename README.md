üìò Lab Evaluation ‚Äì Python Programs

This lab evaluation contains two Python programs based on dictionary operations, file handling, and data analysis.

Q1: Exam Result Filtering (5 Marks)
In this program, a dictionary is used to store student names as keys and their marks as values.
The task is to print the names of students who scored more than 75.
If no student qualifies, the message ‚ÄúNo high scorer found‚Äù is displayed.
The program demonstrates the use of dictionary iteration, list comprehension, and conditional statements.

Q2: Website Log Analyzer (10 Marks)
This program analyzes a log file containing server messages such as errors and warnings.
A sample server.log file is created and filled with log data.
The program reads the file line by line and counts the frequency of each word using a dictionary.
A set is used to find all unique words present in the log.
The program then prints the top 5 most frequent words, all unique words, and the total number of lines in the file.
This demonstrates concepts of file handling, word frequency analysis, sets, and sorting.

The outputs of these programs display student names above a certain mark threshold and detailed log statistics such as word frequency, uniqueness, and line count. Together, these tasks highlight the practical use of Python dictionaries, sets, loops, conditionals, and file operations in solving real-world problems.
